# User Friendly UI for VSCode

## Overview

The User Friendly UI theme for Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is designed to ease the learning curve for new programmers. This theme simplifies the complex and often overwhelming aspects of the code editor into a straightforward and user-friendly interface. Key features are highlighted, while more advanced elements are subtly tucked away, allowing beginners to focus on the essentials of coding.

## Features

* Simplified and intuitive color theme to highlight syntax and ease code readability.
* The explorer and source control icons are given prominence, enabling beginners to easily locate files and track changes.
* Reduced toolbar complexity by removing rarely used items.

## Installation

1. Clone of the current Repo/ download the Zip file and extract contents in the current working file.
2. Reload VsCode and you should have a new optimized user friendly UI.

## Usage

Once you have installed and activated the User Friendly UI, you can simply start coding. The theme will apply its settings automatically, presenting a simplified interface. All buttons and navigational elements will work as usual, but their display will be optimized for beginner friendliness.

## Customization

This theme can be customized to better suit your preferences. To customize, simply navigate to `Code → Preferences → Settings → Workbench → Color Customizations`.
